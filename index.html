    <h1>Lesson 1. Reference types</h1>
    <div>
      <p>There are three types of references in Excel. And then there is R1C1 reference style
        (I will be calling it just 'R1C1' from now on) vs 'usual one'. We will take a look on R1C1 a little bit later.
        So here are reference types:
      </p>
      <ol id="ftable">
          <li><a href="#relative">Relative</a></li>
          <li><a href="ExcelCourseLesson1_1.html">Absolute</a></li>
          <li><a href="ExcelCourseLesson1_2.html">Mixed</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Constant Column</li>
            <li>Constant Row</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Relative reference</h2>
    <h3>R1C1 reference style</h3>
    <p class="text">
      In order to understand <span class="section">Relative reference</span>
      we first need to look into R1C1 reference style .
      But to grasp what is R1C1, we need to go through some basics.
      So every cell in Excel Sheet has its own unique address, which consists
      of a combination of a letter and a digit. Letter represents a column, and
      digit represents a row. For example Cell A1 is located on intersection of
      the column A and the first row. Now if we switch to R1C1 (<a href="R1C1options.html">click here to see how it is done</a>)
      we will see that now columns are in digits as well as rows.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Let's see it on an example. Below you can see the formula '=C3*D3',
      so we are multiplying price by quantity, and we are getting the sum.
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1C1_1.bmp" width="70%">
    <p class="text">
      Now if we change to R1C1 we will see this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/R1C1_2.bmp" width="70%">
    <p class="text">
      So what does the formula '=RC[-2]*RC[-1]' mean? Here 'R' stands for row,
      and as there is no digit after it, it means 'on the same row'. 'C' represents
      column, and it has '[-2]', so it means two columns to the left from the
      current cell. It is interesting that if we copy the formula down, it will
      appear the same in all the cells down (You can check it yourself in your Excel file).
      So we will see something like this:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>quantity</th>
        <th>price</th>
        <th>sum</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>2500</td>
        <td>=RC[-2]*RC[-1]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>150</td>
        <td>=RC[-2]*RC[-1]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>160</td>
        <td>=RC[-2]*RC[-1]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="text">
      The reason that formula is the same in all the cells is that in all these
      cells we refer <span>to a cell on the same row and two columns on the left
      multiplied by a cell on the same row and one column to the left</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      So if we swith back to our 'normal' view (where columns are in letters)
      we will see this kind of formula:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>quantity</th>
        <th>price</th>
        <th>sum</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>2500</td>
        <td>=C3*D3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>150</td>
        <td>=C4*D4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>160</td>
        <td>=C5*D5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="text">
      So how the formula '=RC[-2]*RC[-1]' can be equal to three different
      formulas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>=C3*D3</li>
      <li>=C4*D4</li>
      <li>=C5*D5</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">
      One way to explain it is to say that Excel itself sees this formula in a R1C1 way,
      but shows us (i.e. humans) in a '=C3*D3' way. And that is the reason why
      this type of referencing is called 'Relative'. Because from the point of view of Excel,
      other cells which we refer to lie in a certain number of rows and columns.
