    <h2>Mixed reference</h2>
    <p class="text">We have learned the <span class="section">Absolute Reference</span>. But
    let's imagine that you need to convert your values to three different currencies.
    Using the <span class="section">Absolute Reference</span> you will need to enter
    the formula three times like in the example below:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>sum</th>
        <th>380</th>
        <th>420</th>
        <th>6</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>37500</td>
        <td>=E3/$F$2</td>
        <td>=E3/$G$2</td>
        <td>=E3/$H$2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="text">Then we need to copy each formula down so that all the values are converted
    to a respective currency.</p>
    <p class="text">Is there a way to accomplish this task with one formula? Yes there is (when
    working with a computer programm, we always need to eliminate something repeatetive).
    And the way to do that is to use <span class="section">Mixed Reference</span>.
    We can say that there are two subtypes of <span class="section">Mixed Reference</span>.</p>
    <p class="text">They are:</p>
    <div class="text">
      <ul>
        <li>Constant Column</li>
        <li>Constant Row</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text">Let's see their difference on an example.</p>
      <img src="images\Divide3.bmp" width="70%">
    <p class="text">So when we are entering the formula in the cell F3. First we input equal sign
      then we select the cell E3, and we have this:
    </p>
    <img src="images\Divide4.bmp" width="70%">
    <p class="text">Now we press the F4 button on the keyboard several times until the dollar sign
      is not only before letter E. This way we are making it 'Constant Column'(
      because all our values are in the same column). We add the divide sign. After that we select the cell F2.
      And again we press the F4 button several times, until the dollar sign is note
      only before the digit two. So now our formula looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images\Divide5.bmp" width="70%">
    <p class="text">Now we can copy this formula not only down but also to the right.
    On the image below I wanted to show you what formulas you have on each cell, after
    the copying of the formula down and to the right. So this way we can enter only one
    formula and then copy it.</p>
